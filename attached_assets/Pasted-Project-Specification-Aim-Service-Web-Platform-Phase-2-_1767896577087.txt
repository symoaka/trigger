Project Specification: Aim Service Web Platform (Phase 2)
1. Project Overview
Objective: Expand the current "Chatbox & Shopify Redirection" MVP into a full-featured web application. The current Chatbox will serve as a specific module within this new ecosystem. Aesthetic: The visual identity must remain consistent with the existing dark, space-themed design (nebula background, neon cyan/purple accents, glassy UI elements).

2. Global UI/UX Structure
Background: The existing "starry night/nebula" background must be applied globally across all new pages to ensure brand consistency.

Navigation Bar (New Feature):

Position: Fixed at the top-center of the screen.

Style: Minimalist, transparent or glass-morphism effect.

Menu Items:

Home

Coaching

Our Staff

Playlists

3. Feature Breakdown
A. Home Page (Anasayfa)
Purpose: The landing page to hook users and explain the value of the aim coaching service.

Key Elements:

Hero Section: High-impact text and visuals describing the service (e.g., "Elevate Your Aim," "Professional Coaching").

Visuals: sleek, high-quality graphics compatible with the dark theme.

Call to Action: Buttons or links guiding users to the "Coaching" section.

B. Coaching Page (Koçluk)
Purpose: The bridge between the user and the service providers.

Layout: A grid displaying 4 distinct Coach Slots.

Card Structure (Per Coach):

Coach Name & Avatar.

Short tagline or specialization (e.g., "Tracking Specialist").

Action Button: "Contact" (İletişime Geç).

Integration Logic:

When the "Contact" button is clicked, the current page content should be replaced (or an overlay opened) displaying the Chatbox Interface (the existing project).

Note: The system should ideally recognize which coach was clicked so the chat context is relevant to that specific coach.

C. Our Staff Page (Kadromuz)
Purpose: To showcase the wider team behind the organization.

Layout: A responsive grid displaying 10 slots (initially).

Card Structure:

Profile Picture.

Name.

Role/Title: Specific badges displaying roles such as:

Tweaker

Coach

Pro Player

Community Manager

Admin/Scalability Requirement:

The data for this section (Names, Images, Titles) must be structured (e.g., in a JSON file or database) so that an admin can easily:

Add or remove team members (increase/decrease from 10 slots).

Assign or create custom titles without editing HTML code directly.

D. Playlists Page
Purpose: External Resource redirection.

Behavior:

This is not a physical page within the website.

Clicking "Playlists" in the navigation bar immediately redirects the user to https://evxl.app/.

Implementation: <a href="https://evxl.app/" target="_blank"> logic.
